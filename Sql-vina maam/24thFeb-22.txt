SQL Functions
Scalar Functions
String Functions
lower, upper, initcap, length, concat, all trimming and padding functions, instr, replace, soundex, substr
select * from employee;
Q. display first name, its length, last name , its length of all employees
select first_name, length(first_name) "length", last_name, length(last_name) "length" from employee;
select length('Neosoft Technologies') from dual;
dual is virtual table used to get result from scalar functions on random values.
in mysql if we do not add 'from dual' clause then it also it will work  . https://mysqltutorial.org/tryit/ 
desc dual; // wont work
select * from dual; // it workds dummy column, X value
Q. Show employees whose length of first name and last name is same order them according to length
select * from employee where length(first_name)=length(last_name);
select first_name, last_name, length(first_name) "length" from employee where length(first_name)=length(last_name) order by 3;
update employee set city='pune' where employee_id in(115,555) ;
update employee set city='PUNE' where employee_id=109;

Q. Display all cities from table, cities in upper case, cities in lower case, cities as initial letter capital
select distinct city from employee;
select distinct city,  upper(city), lower(city), initcap(city) from employee;
10 rows, 10 rows, 10 rows, 10 rows
select distinct upper(city) from employee;   Pune, pune, PUNE ----> upper ----> PUNE, PUNE, PUNE ---> distinct ---> PUNE
8 rows

Q. Show which employees live in city 'pUNe';

select * from employee where city='pUNe';  // no data found   
select * from employee where lower(city)=lower('pUNe');  Pune -> pune, PUNE-> pune, pune->pune
Q. display first and last name of employee with concatenation
select concat(first_name, last_name) from employee;
select concat(first_name, ' ',last_name) from employee;  concat takes only 2 arguments. so this query wont work
select concat(concat(first_name,' '), last_name) "name" from employee;  Kishor +Pawar => Kishor Pawar
// simple solution : || operator
select first_name || ' ' || last_name "name" from employee;
Q. Show the employees like following
Kishor Pawar lives in Mumbai
select first_name || ' ' || last_name||' lives in '|| city "name and city" from employee;

 all trimming and padding functions, instr, replace, soundex, substring
 trim function: trimming leading or trailing characters/spaces : rtrim, ltrim, trim
 if 2nd argument is not passed the bydefault spaces are removed.
select last_name, rtrim(last_name, 'ni') from employee; // i, ni, in, n
select last_name, rtrim(last_name, 'r') from employee; 
select first_name, ltrim(first_name, 'K') from employee; 
select first_name, ltrim(lower(first_name), lower('K')) from employee; 
select rtrim('     neosoft      ') "trimm" from employee;
select ltrim('     neosoft      ') "trimm" from employee;
select trim('     neosoft      ') "trimm" from employee;
